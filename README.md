# NFC Wearable Integration Project

This project is part of the **Secure School Bus Management System**.  
It integrates **NFC-based check-ins** using wearable devices (such as smartwatches and wristbands) to improve the safety and efficiency of school bus operations.  

It also includes a **Feeding Program module**, where studentsâ€™ meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks) are logged automatically when they check in with NFC.

##  Project Status: Work in Progress

This repository contains the ongoing development of the NFC wearable integration system.  
The code will be continuously updated as I make progress.  

### Currently Implemented
- Node.js backend setup (Express + MongoDB)  
- React frontend structure (Vite + React)  
- **Feeding Program module**:  
  - Student meal logging via NFC check-in  
  - Meal types: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack  
  - Stored with timestamps in MongoDB  
- Basic student database model  

### Planned Features
- Parent confirmation with OTP during student drop-off  
- Real-time notifications to parents when students check in/out  
- Admin dashboard with monitoring and logs (including feeding program analytics)  
- Multi-factor verification (NFC + parent confirmation)  
- Integration with wearable devices (smartwatches/wristbands)
